        <h2>Why do you need a paper wallet?</h2> 
        <p class="content-p">To keep your Bitcoins safe, you need a secure wallet. Exchanges and online wallets are always connected to the internet. Therefore, they are not suitable for storing cryptocurrencies on the long term. Maintaining a constant online connection will get your wallet exposed to hacker attacks. On the other hand, paper wallets offer cold storage (no connection to the internet), which is considered as one of the safest ways to store your Bitcoins. Paper wallets for cryptos have the same functionality as pocket wallets for cash. While both of them offer storage for your money, as they are physical, they can be lost or stolen. To avoid that, you have to store your paper wallet in a safe location where you have exclusive access to.

        <p class="steps-p">Send any amount of Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Core to the public address based on which type of paper wallet you choose. Please note, you can only store ONE currency (either Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash) in one wallet, but not both!</p><br>

      <div class="panel-body">Start our generator and save the page with your browser. You can do that by right-clicking anywhere on the site and hitting “Save as” or navigating in “File” and clicking on “Save as”. The next step is to disconnect from the internet, open the page from the file you just saved, and generate your private and public keys. Before printing your wallet, make sure your printer is not connected to the internet. After you are done printing, you should delete all files connected to your paper wallet from your computer, clear your browser cache, and reboot your printer (you can also clear the printer’s memory). After that, you can go online and back to business as usual!</div>
